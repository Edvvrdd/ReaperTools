# QikWhoosh

A granular sound design tool built directly into REAPER. Unlike traditional sealed instruments or rigid sample libraries, QikWhoosh turns your entire session into the granular engine. It features a uniquely flexible workflow where every processing stage is fully editable on the timeline — you can tweak volume, pan, pitch, and filter envelopes post-generation, and even recursively re-granulate your output with a single click.


## Requirements

- REAPER 6.x or newer
- [ReaImGui](https://github.com/cfillion/reaimgui) (install via ReaPack)
- ReaPitch (ships with REAPER; make sure Cockos plugins are enabled in Preferences → Plug-ins → VST)

## Install via ReaPack

1. Install [ReaPack](https://reapack.com) if you haven't already
2. In REAPER: **Extensions → ReaPack → Manage repositories**
3. Click **Import/export → Import repositories**
4. Paste this URL: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edvvrdd/GrainWhoosh/main/index.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edvvrdd/GrainWhoosh/main/index.xml)
5. **Extensions → ReaPack → Synchronize packages**
6. Run `Script: QikWhoosh.lua` from the Actions list

## Workflow

1. Create a folder track; add audio items to child tracks beneath it
2. Select the folder track in REAPER
3. Make a time selection spanning the desired whoosh length
4. Click **Generate Stereo** or **Generate Mono**
5. A temp track (default `GW_Temp`) appears at the top of the project with the glued whoosh plus editable volume, pan, pitch, and filter envelopes
6. Drag envelope points, add FX to the temp track, audition in place
7. Click **Resample to Folder** to move the result into the folder as a new child source, or click **Render** to bounce through the full signal chain to a new track

## Buttons

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| **Generate Stereo** | Fresh whoosh with a new random seed, stereo output |
| **Generate Mono** | Same but mono; pan envelope is written flat |
| **Render** | Bounce the temp track through its full signal chain (including ReaPitch, ReaEQ) to a new track below it |
| **Resample to Folder** | Move the glued item from the temp track into the source folder as a new child track — enables recursive granulation without leaving the folder ecosystem |

## Controls

### Source / Sampling section

- **Sampling Mode** — `Uniform` (classic granular: grains cycle through all sources with random offsets) or `Sequential` (each source gets one grain in order, auto-sized to fill the time selection)
- **Grain Size** — duration of each slice in Uniform mode (10–500 ms); ignored in Sequential mode where grain size is auto-calculated
- **Grain Density** — how densely grains overlap; higher values = thicker texture (maps to 15–75% grain overlap; the 15% floor guarantees crossfades at every grain join, preventing clicks)
- Per-grain **Pitch** (±0–20%, via playback rate — grains extend/shrink to preserve the source slice) and **Volume** (±0–15%) randomization, set in the Options popup; Uniform mode only
- **Sampling Direction** — how sources are ordered: Forward, Reverse, Ping-Pong, or Random
- **Inset** — shrinks the grain placement window inside the time selection, giving silent margins at each end

A live preview shows the exact bezier curve that will be written to the temp track's volume envelope.

- **Peak Position** — where in the whoosh the loudest moment sits (0 = start, 1 = end)
- **Hold Time** — fraction of the duration the peak is sustained (0–0.5); creates a flat plateau at maximum
- **Rise Tension** — curvature of the attack; positive bows upward (fast rush-in), negative concaves (slow building tension)
- **Fall Tension** — same for the release side
- **Min Volume Floor** — set in Options (−60 dB to −20 dB). Controls the volume floor at envelope edges. −60 ≈ total silence, −20 dB leaves audible texture. Default: −30 dB.

### Doppler section

Toggles pitch, filter, and pan envelopes that simulate a moving sound source. All three share the same attack/release curvature from the Volume Envelope section but have independent peak positions.

**Pitch**
- **Intensity** — signed slider (0–±12 semitones). Positive = up-then-down (approach), negative = down-then-up (recede), zero = disabled
- **Mode** — selectable in Options: **Shift Full** (±24 st range), **Shift Semitones** (±12 st), **Shift Cents** (±100 cent range for subtle shifts), **Formant Full** (formant-preserving shift at ±24 st range)

**Filter**
- **Intensity** — depth of the high-pass sweep (0–100%), via the green knob on the right edge of the visualizer. The high-pass starts thin at the edges of the whoosh (up to 2 kHz at full intensity) and opens fully at the peak, letting the low end through as the source "arrives". 0% bypasses the filter.

**Pan**
- **Strength / Direction** — signed slider: center = no sweep, negative = L→R sweep, positive = R→L sweep. Magnitude controls offset strength

### Output / Generation section

- **Inset** — shrinks the grain placement window inside the time selection. allowing for longer sampling duration but generating a quicker sounding whoosh
- **Track Name** — name of the temp track; auto-appends `_1`, `_2`, etc. if a track with that name already exists
- **Status** — live feedback on generation progress and errors

## Preview Visualizer

The live preview at the bottom of the window shows:

- **Volume envelope** (cyan) — the bezier curve that will be written to the temp track
- **Pitch envelope** (magenta) — ReaPitch automation curve (visible when Doppler is enabled)
- **Filter envelope** (green) — ReaEQ high-pass automation line (visible when filter intensity is above 0)
- **Grain background** — in Uniform mode, a dense texture of vertical lines; in Sequential mode, numbered blocks with neon borders showing source order

## Recursive granulation

The output of one whoosh can become the source for the next. Use **Resample to Folder** to move the glued item into the source folder as a new child track, select the folder, make a new time selection, and hit Generate again. Stack as many layers as you like — a whoosh-of-whooshes-of-whooshes takes about 30 seconds.

## Known limitations

- Source files must still exist at their original paths; grains skip sources that have been moved or deleted since the last session
- ReaPack auto-update requires syncing manually; REAPER doesn't push updates automatically
- Sequential mode supports up to 10 source tracks

## Feedback

Issues and feature requests welcome on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Edvvrdd/GrainWhoosh/issues). Particularly interested in hearing about source-material combinations that produce unexpected results — the tool was designed for emergent texture and the failure modes are often more interesting than the successes.
